# solidity_timecapsule
Learning solidity by building a timecapsule

## Idea
Write a smart contract that stores a message or decoder key stored on the ETH blockchain that when a certain date(time) in the future is reached, with the proper credentials/ownership, can be unlocked/decrypted and revealed. (Could be a message to the future and that's it, or could be a 'treasure map' to a physical object/location.)

### Learning Concepts
* solidity smart contracts
* truffle
* extensibility of contract(s) (per) timecapsule
* how to encrypt and decrypt
* security and ownership
* keeping cost low with ETH gas

## Development
Created with [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
Requirements-
1. Node.js v8+ LTS and npm (comes with Node)
2. Git
run bash```npm install -g truffle```
